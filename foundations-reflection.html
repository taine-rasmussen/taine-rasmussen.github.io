        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt">I noticed just how I would look for distraction or escape when pressed with something difficult. A willingness to attempt to take the path of least resistance. In saying that I was surprised how well I was able to notice this feeling coming on and push through. Finally letting go of habits of comparison was a healthy but difficult one that will be continually worked on, learning to focus on just myself made the process more fulfilling for myself and while under the stress of learning at such a fast rate not being stress about where you are on some imaginary hierarchy you've built in your own head is nice change.
            </p>

        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?

        </h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt">For me these three aspects ensure that throughout this process I am bringing my best self to the situation with the right intentions for me and the others that I interact with. </p>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt">How in some cases I could feel stuck just like I feel in the tech work, trying to dig deeper or analysis my own reasoning/thoughts to get to the answers I am know to be correct for myself.</p>

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt"> The vulnerability of the process. To be fully present and tend to the core work as it asks requires a true honesty due to the nature of the questions asked.
            </p>

        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt">Regardless of how technically capable someone might be in all work and especially tech where its so collaborative if you are not able to work with others you will cause more troubles/discomfort that any talent you might have will be worth.</p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

            <p class="lPlantxt">I do not think it is a waste of time at all. In line with the answer to the above question, making sure you are aware of the person you are and how to interact with others or how challenges/problems affect you and the others around is key to making sure that you are able to address anything that needs addressing so you can be a part of a wider team and contribute your worth.
