      <h1>Identity, Values & Strengths</h1>  


      <h3> Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
      <p class="lPlantxt">Two years ago during the early months of 2019 I was working as a marketing executive for an unnamed company,  it was during this time the then COO engaged in what can only be described as sexual misconduct with a much younger/junior member of staff. Keeping the details short, news of the event was taken to our in house lawyers who took it straight to the CEO, he tried to first brush it under the rug & hide it from the board and other members of SMT, when that didn't work and the victims lawyers proved the COO was lying about the events of that the CEO and by extension the company decided to try pay the victim off. Eventually the truth becomes known to the wider company & you couldn't keep up with how fast the resignations were coming across HR's desk. While everyone with options had already left I still remained and the only management left were the small group of people that let this happen in the first place. 

        It was the first time my version of what is right and wrong were being challenged in a professional setting, mostly due to the privilege I have. I knew leaving would mean giving up the "good job/pay" & with the limited experience I had at that time it would be difficult to leverage that into another position of similar quality. In saying that I left quick and fast, material or monetary value in a job means nothing when you know you can't be supporting certain people, behaviours and ideas. 
        
        In terms of consequences, while I knew I might make the right decision I was back working a entry level job again, not that there's anything wrong with these jobs I just knew I had more to offer and to come full circle during this time I decided to start my dev journey which has led me here.

        <h3> Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p class="lPlantxt">Questions of culture have been a difficult one for me to answer. Coming from a NZ European background & at least in my experience is not one rich with culture. From my experience with people I have met and built relationships with from different cultures & backgrounds it's easy to see how their cultures have shaped them & help build their identity. This isn't a feeling or experience I've ever had & even after reflecting on it over the years as I get older still feel as my culture is one of the least impactful things on my values and identity. I’m always open to expanding that and look forward to seeing how that evolves over time & with new experiences. </p>

        <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>

        <p class="lPlantxt">Starting with limitations, imposter syndrome and not enough self belief have hurt me in the past, not letting me see through a roadblock I might be stuck at giving up earlier than my potential can reach. While my strength is persistence and self awareness in those moments to address the feelings during the above mentioned limitations & how they are affecting myself, my work and others. While its sounds counteractive, these strengths and limitations are always being worked on and over time you become better at noticing them & mitigating the effects.</p>

        <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>

        <p class="lPlantxt">Persistence is what came to mind first, from talking to people who are already in the industry, who have gone through the course before and from my experience of starting large projects in the past consistency is key. Being able to acknowledge how far there might be to go & how confused or stuck you might feel at any given time but continuing anyway has been the key to the success I have had in the past. Before you know it you will be doing things a past version of yourself couldn't even understand, that's an amazing feeling and its surprising how fast you can get there if you just keep pushing.</p>

        <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>

        <p class="lPlantxt">In the past I worked in a contact centre, the system we used was getting the job but had long way to go in terms of improvement and optimising. The general feeling in the team was things could be better but the manger wasn't going to change anything. A few others and myself found after a few conversations with our manger about such changes it appeared to be case of they were to busy to care. They assumed we were demanding them to think of and implement the changes all on their own. Instead we approached them with a road map of ideas, why they would be good, how they can be implemented, what needs to be done to get that to happen and how we can help in that process so the weight is just on them.

          Looking back on that situation now I feel given the person & situation we were dealing with we came to the same answer I would now. We found a way to push through and get the changes we needed by doing it ourselves when requests for support were ignored.
