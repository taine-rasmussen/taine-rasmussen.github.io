      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

      <h3>What’s your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p class="lPlantxt">The ultimate goal is to build a life that is fulfilling and provides me with the freedoms I desire both professionally and personally. While still figuring out the specifics I do know what I want long term. In terms of work I had been looking for something that I'm interested in that will challenge me intellectually & also double as an opportunity to further explore my creativity via different mediums. After some experimenting I felt web development had ticked those boxes for me and started me on this journey. While I don’t have a specific niche to head towards as of yet I am using this experience and my experiences to come to help answer that question and guide me along that journey. While pursuing these professional goals I take great value from personal experiences as well, a big part of that so far has been travel. Ultimately I want to be living in other countries but want to be able to make a living doing so. Tech lined up perfectly for this due the demand for the skill in most countries and even the ability to work remote. Once I have a leverageable amount of experience I am excited to see where I end up around the world.</p>

      <h3>strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h3>
      <p class="lPlantxt">Starting with limitations, imposter syndrome and not enough self belief have hurt me in the past, not letting me see through a roadblock I might be stuck at giving up earlier than my potential can reach. While my strength is persistence and self awareness in those moments to address the feelings during the above mentioned limitations & how they are affecting myself, my work and others. While its sounds counteractive, these strengths and limitations are always being worked on and over time you become better at noticing them & mitigating the effects.</p>

      <h3>What non-technical skills would you like to see developed while at edA?</h3>
      <p class="lPlantxt">I am looking forward to developing a further sense of self when involved in group work, both the role I am able to play in that scenario and how I might better work with others. Working a lot of isolated jobs in the past has been great as I'm naturally quiet introverted but I feel like I am leaving a lot out in terms of experience, opportunity and growth both personally & professionally.</p>

      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
      <p class="lPlantxt">Structure and honest communication are the two things that mainly come to mind when I think about this. With self guided learning being such a large part of this experience self imposed structure is a key pillar to success in this for me. Being able to plan ahead, know what I am supposed to be doing and when to be doing it removes a lot of the anxiety from the experience and allows me to just dive into the work when I need/want to & also not feel guilty when not working. That paired with honest communication allows me to stay accountable to myself & others during this course, letting others to be able to rely on me when needed and not let myself down with my own predetermined goals. Lastly, what will I do when it all gets a bit much and I can feel the pressure building? Firstly knowing that I am not alone in this experience is reassuring & the support structure available makes me feel that even if something is getting to me there is help just a message away. This makes the whole experience feel less isolating & that in itself helps ease a lot to begin with. Aside from that I am aware of my own emotions and any affect that might be having is the other half to this. I might just need to get some fresh air, take a walk or chat to someone else, whatever it might be as long as one of these actions is taken so not to let in boil up inside you and become worse than
        it needs to be.
       </p>

       <h3>how and where you will seek help in a timely way?</h3>
       <p class="lPlantxt">Depending on the situation I know I have great backing from my facilitator and the other EDA staff I am yet to meet, while at the same time a group of soon to be not strangers that are going through the exact same thing I am. I can’t really put a number on it but it's pretty clear when I am stuck with something when active problem solving is not getting anywhere and I'm going in circles, for me it's in that moment that it's best to ask for help.</p>

       <h3>What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h3>
       <p class="lPlantxt">Availability & honesty is what comes to mind for me. What this looks like to me is that within available working hours I can find someone to reach out to chat with about whatever it might be. In regards to honesty I am just looking to learn from my mistakes, highlight areas of opportunity, what have I done wrong, is there a more effective way of doing this etc.. This going for both Tech and Core related topics, I am here to grow and would love any help in doing so.
      </p>

      <h3>Scheduling information?</h3>
      <p class="lPlantxt">Working from home it does feel a little cabin fevery sometimes which is why most mornings I aim to do something that gets me out of the house whether it’s going to gym, running errands or getting some snacks for the day ahead I have found this gets that distraction out of the way for me and allows me settle into the work day better. Whatever it might be I always aim to have my work day started by 11am at the latest. With the expectation of my weekly catch up on thursday mornings of course.
