      <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1>

      <h3>An analogy to describe the difference between HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p class="lPlantxt">HTML can be looked at as the builder in this scenario, its job is to build the structure that holds everything together while CSS comes in as a designer and builds on top of what is already there. Taking what the frames have laid out and styling it in any which way you can imagine.
        </p>

      <h3>What is control flow?</h3>
        <p class="lPlantxt">What is control flow?
            Control flow when defined is the order in which a computer executes statements in a script. That's all good and well but what does that actually look like? Let's use an example! For this example we are going to imagine you are walking to your favourite store. You know how to get there, down the road, around the corner and across the street. Without control flow if you followed these directions how long would it take to walk into something/someone on the footpath or get hit because you walked out into a busy street. Control flow allows us to step in and add extra parameters when needed, for example when you come across a street execute code that stops walking and looks both ways, confirm its safe and then continue with the original directions.
            </p>

      <h3>What is the DOM and how do you interact with it?</h3>
        <p class="lPlantxt">The Document Object Model (DOM) is what allows us to interact & apply javascript to our HTML. It resembles a family tree which allows you to be as precise or as wide reaching as you like when making changes. For example imagine making every one of your cousins have green hair or maybe just one, with DOM if you can think of it you can do it.</p>

      <h3>Whats the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
        <p class="lPlantxt">Beginning with arrays we should note they use use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item an index of 1 etc… so if we had an array of 5 different city names and we want access the first one we would write that as cityNames[0] . Additionally Items can be added and removed from the beginning or end of an array using the push(), pop(), unshift(), and shift() methods.
            <br>
            <br>
            Lastly we have Objcets. Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game. Basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value. Properties in objects can be accessed, added, changed, and removed by using either dot or bracket notation. If we had an object called person holding basic info about them you could access it like the following - person.age or person[‘age’] . Both of these would return the same value.
            </p>

      <h3>What are functions and why are they useful?</h3>
      <p class="lPlantxt">Functions are blocks of code that preform a task, this could be as simple as adding two numbers or as complex as you would like to make it. One of the many benefits of functions is that if you need to use that block of code again you don’t have to write out all that code again, you can just call whatever you named your function and it perform that block of code you already wrote..or copied from the internet. </p>
