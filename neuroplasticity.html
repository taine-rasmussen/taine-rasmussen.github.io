        <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
        

        <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:</h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt">Understanding neuroplasticity can be hugely important and influential on one's ability to learn and grow in all aspects of life. The principle of continued growth can help free someone from a static mindset and help them see that with effort that is in their control they are able to influence what they once thought was unchangeable.
            </p>

        <h3>Discuss how might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit:
        </h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt">Adding on to the aspects of this course that already reinforce neuroplasticity practices I make an effort to consistently reflect, journal and cover material I am working with in an effort to understand the logic of it better and be able to describe it.</p>

        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity:</h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt">Increasing your neuroplasticity can be done in a number of ways including but not limited to setting meaningful goals and making consistent steps towards it, adopting a growth mindset, practicing mindfulness to help with your self awareness and raising your standards - set higher expectations of how you want your life to be.</p>

        <h3>Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging:</h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt"> <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/">This link!</a> Provides a full overview of the topic and active ways you can engage with the topic for positive change.</p>

        <h3>Discuss a growth mindset and why it is relevant?</h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt">Having a growth mindset is about changing the way you view the world and operate within it. Where other outlooks might believe obstacles are to be avoided and challenges are a sign to give up, the growth mindset looks at these as a sign of opportunity and growth. Being able to overcome these things can help show yourself you are stronger than you thought and with some resilience you have no idea what the upper limit of yourself could be.</p>

        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt">The simplicity of the idea in contrast to how effective it can be when applied. Despiste how tough it might feel sometimes at its core a growth mindset is an easy to gage and easy to start executing exercise yet the potential return is arguably uncapped.</p>

        <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p class="lPlantxt">For me this is an exercise of my attitude and outlook when faced with challenges, its in those moments I have the best opportunity to engage with this practice, push through, learn and grow.
            </p>
