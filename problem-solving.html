      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  
      <h3>Got Blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <p class="lPlantxt" >Not one specific problem but rather a common issue I have come across so var while learning JS is what can be best described as a blurry retention of how certain features work. After being set a task I have a blurry idea of how it might work but have a hard time implementing this when it actually comes to writing the code. Like a word you’ve forgotten yet it feels like it's on the tip of your tongue this has been a frustrating experience, working through that feeling and being conscious of a growth mindset over a fixed one has been key to having more and more moments where it feels like it's all coming together. A combination of pseudocode and rubber ducky method have been working the best for me, while I don’t feel like I have a confident hold over JS yet pseudocode helps me get the ideas out and down while not feeling like I am having to carry it all in my mind. In combination the rubber ducky method then helps work through concepts I don’t fully understand yet to help simplify them and gain a better perspective.</p>

      <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
        <p class="lPlantxt">At this stage I don’t feel like I have a specific example of this, the challenges have felt like a bit of a fight to get through at this stage. Nothing elegant during this experience has happened for me so far haha, at least not yet. I'm looking forward to that moment though! Despite this it has been a great learning curve, experimenting with the problem solving techniques mentioned in the above article has really helped me shape & refine my learning style. Staring to see the benefits of that and gradually feeling more confident with JS continues to be the most satisfying part of the course so far.</p>

      <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h3>
      <ul class="lPlantxt">
        <li >  Pseudocode - I love the idea of this as I feel like I have been most  successful in task when I can create a good plan using this method however a good plan comes with a good understanding of the problem which so far has been my biggest problem with gaps in my knowledge.
        </li>

        <li>
          Trying something - fairly confident. This has been one of my methods I always fallback on when i'm not sure. Just testing all the ideas that come to mind and seeing where that takes me and what I can learn from those results.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rubber ducky method - Another one of my most used methods, helping work through concepts I don’t fully understand yet to help simplify them and gain a better perspective has been a huge help to volume of content we are trying to learn in this timeframe
        </li>
        <li>
          Reading error messages - Really reliable, even when I don’t know what I am doing I can always count on an error message to point me in the right direction.

        </li>
        <li>
          Console.logging - tied in with the “trying something” method these two go hand in hand for me, taking an almost brute force approach and adjusting of the results given slowly getting closer and closer to the answer I need.

        </li>
        <li>
          Googling - My saving grace, not matter how confused I might be about something there is always a resource that breaks it down for me, you just have to do a bit of digging. A lot of times just reading or watching something be presented in multiple ways can be what really makes it click for me.
        </li>
        <li>
          Asking your peers for help - Probably my least utilized method on this list, the remote setting is the reason why. Being in person I think this would be different because this interaction can be instant and reactive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Asking coaches for help - A great help when I really feel like I am stuck and can’t see a way out I always know I can reach out.
        </li>

      <li>
        Improving your process with reflection - really confident with this method as well, reflecting and going over the concepts we are learning is what really helps things stick for me.
      </li>
        

      </ul>
